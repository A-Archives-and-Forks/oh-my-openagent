## 2026-09-17 — stamp the engine build epoch into compiled binaries

`build-info.ts` derives `EngineBuildStamp { scheme, epoch, sha7, source }` from omob
`OmoBuildInfo.engine` (commit + committedAt) or, for a release compile, from the pinned
`@code-yeongyu/senpi` package.json (`gitHead` plus `committedAt` / `gitCommittedAt` /
`gitHeadCommittedAt`). A missing timestamp is scheme `nodef` with epoch 0 — never `Date.now()`.

`compile-entry.ts` `versionLine` records which path the build took: omob `--version` includes
`+<epoch>.<sha7> (scheme epoch)`; a define-less release prints `scheme nodef`.

`script/engine-build-defines.ts` turns an epoch stamp into bun `--define SENPI_BUILD_EPOCH=…`
`--define SENPI_BUILD_SHA7="…"` and omits both for `nodef`. `script/build-omo-binary.ts` passes
those defines on every `bun build --compile` that has a stamp; `build-omob.ts` inherits them
through `--build-info`. Correctness of handoff does not depend on the define: a missing define
is scheme `nodef`, which per I2 never initiates a handoff.
